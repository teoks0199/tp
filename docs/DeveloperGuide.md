### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-stall s/1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete-stall s/1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-stall s/1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a stall).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Stall` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStallList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Stall` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Stall>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort stalls by price feature

#### Implementation

The proposed sort stalls price functionality is facilitated by `SortStallsPriceCommand`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![SortPriceSequenceDiagram](images/SortPriceSequenceDiagram.png)

`sortStallPrice` is a method in `ModelManager` that sorts the filtered stall list by price.
It calls `sortByPrice` in `UniqueStallList` which sorts the list of stalls by price which makes use of
`StallPriceComparator` to compare the prices of the stalls.

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How sort stalls price executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Saves the sorted list of stalls in FoodNotes.
    * Pros: User does not need to re-sort list after every command.
    * Cons: Original ordering of stalls will be lost.

* **Alternative 2:** Displays the sorted list of stalls only.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: User needs to re-sort stalls by price after every command if they want to view the sorted list.


### Add item and delete item feature

#### Implementation:

The add-item/delete-item mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model`, stored internally as an `UniqueItemLis`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addItem()` and `Model#deleteItem()` respectively with the addition of getters and setters.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add-item operation works:

![AddItemSequenceDiagram](images/AddItemSequenceDiagram.png)


The `delete-item` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#deleteItem()`, which deletes the specified item from its specified stall.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `stallIndex` or `itemIndex` is at index out of range of `filteredStallList.size() - 1` or , then there are no stalls to delete the item from.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/AddItemActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Number of fields needed to be entered by the user:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Only require them to enter the stall they belong to and the name of the item**
    * Pros: The review field is optional and users can add items without a review.
    * Cons: Causes some fields to be null when initialised (e.g. `rating` and `review`) and more code is needed to implement.

* **Alternative 2: Require all fields required to be present when adding an item:**
    * Pros: Less code is needed to implement.
    * Cons: Users are restricted to only adding items when they have a review.


### Find-by-item feature

#### Implementation

The find item feature is facilitated by `FindItemCommand` that extends `Command`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find item operation works:

![FindItemSequenceDiagram](images/FindItemSequenceDiagram.png)

The `MenuContainsKeywordsPredicate` is used to filter the list of stalls in FoodNotes. It is created with a list of keywords, and it checks if the menu items of a stall contains any of the keywords.
#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Number of fields needed to be entered by the user:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows the user to search for stalls containing any of the keywords.
    * Pros: Users can search for multiple items at once, for example they can look for stalls that sell either "chicken" or "apple".
    * Cons: More complicated to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Only allow the user to search for one keyword at a time.
    * Pros: Easy to implement as parsing one keyword is more simple than parsing multiple keywords.
    * Cons: Less flexible for the user.


### Add stall review feature

#### Implementation

The add stall review feature is facilitated by `AddStallReviewCommand` that extends `Command`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add stall review operation works:

<img src="images/ReviewStallDiagram.png"/>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Number of fields needed to be entered by the user:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows the user to enter the stall's review, rating and description.
    * Pros: Users can enter multiple fields for the stall's review at once, do not have to add individual fields one by one.
    * Cons: Some users may feel that it is too troublesome to enter multiple fields at once.

* **Alternative 2:** Only allow the user to enter one field at a time.
    * Pros: Easy to implement as parsing one keyword is more simple than parsing multiple keywords.
    * Cons: More troublesome for the user as they have to enter multiple fields one by one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### View stall feature

#### Implementation

The view stall feature is facilitated by `ViewStallCommand` that extends `Command`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find item operation works:

![ViewStallDiagram](images/ViewStallDiagram.png)

The `updateFilteredStallListPredicate` is used to filter the list of stalls in FoodNotes. It is created with a the name of the stall entered by the user.

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: Details displayed:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Details of the stalls (menu items and review) are only displayed when the view-stall command is entered. Otherwise, only the average price of the stall and star rating will be shown.
  * Pros: The interface will not be cluttered with information. The menu items and detailed reviews will only be shown when users want to find out more.
  * Cons: More cards and fxml panels will be needed, making it more complicated to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** All the information is displayed in the list of stalls.
  * Pros: Easy to implement as only one card and fxml stallPanel is required.
  * Cons: The interface will be cluttered with information and when there is many menu items, the users will have to scroll within each card, making it less user-friendly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Planned Enhancements**

### Make it clearer to the user that the list of stalls is filtered.
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** Users can view a filtered list of stalls when they use commands such as `find-by-location` and `find-by-item`. In the case where there is only 1 stall in the list and the user performs a stall deletion, the user will see a page showing an empty list of stall. This might cause confusion as the user might think that all the stalls are deleted.
* **Example:**
1. User enters `find-by-location Deck`.
2. A list of stalls containing one stall is displayed.
3. User enters `view-stall s/1` to view the details of the stall.
4. User enters `delete-stall s/1` to remove the stall from FoodNotes.
5. List of stalls with no stalls is displayed.
6. The list of stalls is still filtered by location which is the Deck, but it might give the wrong impression that there are no more stalls in FoodNotes.

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose to enhance the filter stalls commands to display the list of stalls with a short description saying that the list is filtered.
1. Edit the card that displays the list of stalls.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 100 stalls without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. A user should not experience any noticeable sluggishness in performance when sorting or searching for stalls.
5. The data of the application is stored locally.

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Card**: Used to display information including texts and images, in a structured and organised way.
* **GUI**: Graphical User Interface
* **Jar file**: A Java Archive file used to distribute and run Java applications
* **Result Display**: The component in the main window that displays the success/error messages to users whenever a command is entered.
* **Left Display**: The component in the main window that displays the list of stalls in FoodNotes. When filtering commands such as `find-by-location` are used, the _Left Display_ will display the filtered list of stalls.
* **Right Display**: The component in the main window that displays the list of valid commands to be used in FoodNotes. When `view-stall` or `view-item` commands are used, the _Right Display_ will display the details of the stall/menu item.

   3. If the user wishes to have the preloaded data, they can delete the corrupted data file and upon launch, FoodNotes will automatically create a new data file with the preloaded data.

2. Dealing with missing data files
   1. To simulate a missing data file, you can delete `addressbook.json` from the data folder.
   2. In the event of a missing data file, FoodNotes will automatically create a new data file with the preloaded data.
