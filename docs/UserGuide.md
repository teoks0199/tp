## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide of FoodNotes!


Ever find yourself forgetting the delightful dishes you savored? Hungry for a way to recall your favorite food experiences? FoodNotes has the solution.

FoodNotes is a quick, simple and beautiful food diary made specifically for you, NUS student foodies. With FoodNotes, you can add stalls that you want to keep track of and manage your reviews for them.

This application is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This means that you operate the application by typing commands into a _Command Box_. If you are fast at typing, FoodNotes can help you manage your food reviews faster than other Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

FoodNotes is available for the Linux, Unix, Windows and Mac OS operating systems.

### 4.4 Stall Finding <a id="stall-finding"></a>

These features allow you to find stalls in FoodNotes. The finding features include:
- Finding stalls by name
- Finding stalls by location
- Finding stalls by item

#### 4.4.1 Finding stalls by name: `find-by-name` <a name="finding-stalls-by-name"></a>
You can use this command to quickly locate specific food stalls based on their names. Even if you can only remember part of the stall name, this command can help you narrow down your choices effectively.

**Format:**

`find-by-name NAME_KEYWORD`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">


:information_source: **Info:**<br>
If you have a "Japanese Stall" in FoodNotes, you can find it using `find-by-name japanese`
as the `find` commands are case-insensitive.
However, partial or incomplete matches won't count as a match, thus`find-by-name japan` will not return any results as "japan" is not an exact match for "japanese".

**Example:**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-white">
