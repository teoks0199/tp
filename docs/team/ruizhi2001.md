Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete items to stalls in FoodNotes.
    * **PR(s):** [#62](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/62)
    * **What it does:** Allows the user to add items to a stall.
    * **Justification:** This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to add items to a stall, which is a core feature of FoodNotes.
    * **Highlights:** This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future as any change to the fields of a stall or item will change how it is added. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, for example how to handle adding reviews if they don't already exist, as it is not compulsory for stalls or items to have reviews in FoodNotes.
    * **Credits:** The ability to have optional parameters while adding was adapted from the `AddCommand` class in the original AB3.
  

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort stalls by location or rating in FoodNotes.
  * **PR(s):** [#101](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/pull/101)
  * **What it does:** Allows the user to sort stalls by location or rating.
  * **Justification:** This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to sort stalls, which is a core feature of FoodNotes.
  * **Highlights:** This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in the future as it is a standalone feature.


* **Bug fixing**: Fixed UI bugs in FoodNotes.
